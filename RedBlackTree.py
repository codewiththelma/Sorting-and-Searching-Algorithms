Purpose: This file implemented creation of a Red Black Tree and
insertion operation in the three.

In a nutshell, there are two classes: NewNode that creates an instance of new node to be added in the tree
and the class RedBlackTree which  contains methods for creating a new Node, insertion and maintaining the balance in the tree.
